We do not get to choose our families, but we do get to choose our friends. You have 
                    been closer than family to me. On this day of your birth, I wish you every happiness 
                    and blessing. Congratulations! You grew up one more year. Soon, you'll be 23, then 30, 
                    then 35, then 40, and so on. And, if things go right for you then, in the meantime, 
                    you'll be achieving your goals, getting married, having kids, see your kids getting married 
                    , and having grandchildren. And if you are lucky enough, you'll see your grandchildren marry 
                    as well. And then eventually, you'll die. But mind you, these will only happen if things 
                    go right for you. Things might go wrong for you, and maybe some night you might get highly 
                    drunk and jump off the terrace of a building thinking it's a swimming pool down there and 
                    die pitifully. No matter what, eventually, you're going to die. And today, you are 
                    officially one year closer to your death. Being a friend of yours, I would like to express 
                    my condolence upon your death. But maybe, by the time you die, we might not be in contact 
                    with one another. So today, in the name of your oncoming death, I wholeheartedly express 
                    my grief in advance... 
                    With Best Regards,
                    Md. Asraful Sharker Nirob
